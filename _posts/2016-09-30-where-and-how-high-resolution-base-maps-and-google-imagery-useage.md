It's been about 18 months since the statewide high resolution (6") aerial photography services, licensed from google and funded through the Utah Mapping and Information Partnership, began serving state and local government from agrc's discover server.

So, what have we learned so far? A lot actually, thanks to the two resources: an extensive user survey and metrics collected by the server itself.

The user survey, conducted this Spring, identifies how the aerial photography services are being used, what the benefits are to organizations using the license, and suggestions for future updates and enhancements. A [summary of the Utah High Res (6") Aerial Photography User Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iwLi8icm3OqF0GvEnblD6REiwcmUdug03Dny2vvXMMM/edit?usp=sharing) is now available, and includes a list of all [open text comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iwLi8icm3OqF0GvEnblD6REiwcmUdug03Dny2vvXMMM/edit?usp=sharing) is available as Google documents.

Usage metrics from the server, identify who is using the services, how much, and maybe most importantly WHERE use is the highest in the state. While the server metrics likely understate use (since they do not account for on-premise large-area mosaics, downloaded jp2 files, and client caching of imagery tiles already viewed), they emphatically show usage has steadily increased and, that usage, as expected, varies greatly in different parts of the state. 

The WHERE piece to the imagery question is important as total area is most expensive component for all models of aerial photography acquisition. And as Utah consider what areas to reacquire or subscribe to, having a spatial representation of usage is key.

While high resolution aerial photography is potentially valuable anywhere in the state, this is nothing better than a map to shows where it has been used the most. This map depicts the number of imagery tiles requested from the discover server at scales where 6" resolution makes an impact (scales between of 1:2000 and 1:500). It aggregates the number of tiles requested into grid cells of about 1 square mile in size.

Information from the recent user survey and from server logs that describe and depict usage will greatly impact the imagery recommendations and business plan, in progress, that AGRC will present to the UMIP Steering Commitee and partners, as we consider next steps in this arena.
