<p>On <strong>February 29, 2012</strong> the first Maps on the Hill event will be held. Each year maps are used in government, business, and education for a wide variety of applications. Maps on the Hill gives mapping students and professionals an opportunity to share their hard work with Utah's elected leaders.</p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Who is Involved:</h2>
<p>Professionals and students from any private or public organization are invited to submit their projects from the past year for inclusion in this event. This event provides an opportunity to highlight your organization and the critical role geospatial information plays at all levels of decision making. Utah's elected officials, the media, and the general public will be invited to attend the event and view the maps.</p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Event Information:</h2>
<p>The event will be held in the Utah State Capitol Rotunda during the 2012 Utah Legislative General Session. We invite participants to present hard copy maps, online interactive maps, or online mapping applications. We are happy to print out maps for participants, please let us know in your submission if you need a map printed. If we are printing out your map, the size we are asking for is 30 x 40 inches, all other maps should be around that size.</p>
<p>If you need other equipment such as a computer, projector screen, or easel for hard copy maps, we encourage you to bring your own, but please notify us what you will be bringing so we can plan space accordingly. If you need equipment that you are unable to bring, please contact us and we will try and work with you. Also contact us if you have any questions on how your map will be displayed.</p>
