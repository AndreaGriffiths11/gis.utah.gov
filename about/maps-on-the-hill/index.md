Maps on the Hill, an event held at the State Capitol during the Utah Legislative Session, is supported by the Utah Geographic Information Council ([UGIC](http://ugic.info/)) and AGRC. The event highlights interesting maps and mapping technology with elected officials, fellow practitioners and the public. Students and professionals present on a broad range of topics to show the diversity of mapping resources in Utah, and to demonstrate how mapping technology can be used to support decision makers.
