<p>Maps are used in government, business, and education for a wide variety of applications. The Maps on the Hill event gives mapping professionals and students an opportunity to share their latest work with Utah's elected officials and the public.</p>
<p>Who should submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals: Anybody who makes a map through their work or education.</li>
<li>Organizations: An organization that has worked on multiple mapping projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maps on the Hill Event:</p>

<li>Map displays will be set up in the Capitol Rotunda, and the public and elected officials will be able to browse between the many maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Display Types</p>
<ul>
<li>You can submit hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (you'll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.</li>
<li>The focus of the event is interesting <em>maps</em> that are applicable to a wide variety of audiences.</li>
<li>Maps can be of any topic</li>
<li>This event is not a product/services marketing opportunity, it's purpose is to show elected officials the cool maps that people in Utah are making.</li>
</ul>
