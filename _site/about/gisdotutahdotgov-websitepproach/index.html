  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The groundwork for the enhancements were laid in the Fall of 2011, based upon observations and feedback received on our old site, as well larger trends in the collaborative technologies field.</p>
<p>The main premise behind the new website is that consumers of GIS and other mapping information expect to be able to discover mapping information the same way that they find other information. Namely, carefully selected keywords are entered into a Google, Bing, Yahoo, or other 'big search'  text box. Then the user peruses the top 3-10 ranked search results and decides to investigate links or further refine the search keywords.</p>
<p>The new site does not have emphasize a built-in search or catalog application to discover map data and services. Instead, it is designed almost exclusively to work with ‘big search.’ A strong emphasis has been placed on organizing information regarding data, services, and events into individual pages, each with its own URL. As domain names (ex. gis.utah.gov) are a preeminent modern form of branding, search engines heavily weight these in their ranking algorithms. And, consumers wise employ a similar strategy to form their search keywords. Outcomes of the new approach will be favorably judged, if after a initial period of time,  Utah GIS and mapping data can be found the same way other information is found. A Google search of "utah.gov gis road data" returning a top 5 ranked link to a page describing the statewide roads-related  data, basic meta information, and links to data, services, and related maps and application, means the new approach is on the right track.</p>
<p>Another component of the new site strategy is including, on each data and service page, the key meta information describing each dataset. This improves the accessibility and usability of data while aiding overall discoverability by search engines. Doing this also helps AGRC to navigate the current diverging approaches to metadata taken by GIS user communities, IT professionals as a whole, and software providers. With each geospatial resource having its own dedicated web page, perhaps the only critical information in the existing metadata standards are the currency and publishing dates and the "Online Linkage"? Time will tell.</p>
<p>Other significant changes are noteworthy. When the old "Utah GIS Portal" website was released in December of 2007, many collaborative-oriented functions were included. However, more compelling platforms for sharing professional association, content comments, forums, code, etc. quickly emerged and gained adoption by IT professionals shortly thereafter. For this reason, the new site is much simpler but does have the ability to embed the capabilities of multiple social media channels such as twitter, linkedin, github, flicker, etc.</p>
<p>The site consists of two principal content management system components: 1) resource pages and 2) blog-style news items. AGRC is also choosing to embed a moderated twitter feed (#utmap) and listserv subscription capability. In the future, the site will evaluate incorporating additional maturing SaaS channels as they gain adoption, such as ArcGIS Online. In the meantime, the core site will present simple straight-forward content that is as user friendly and discoverable as possible.</p>
<p>It is hoped that using a more distributed approach to architecting access and use of geospatial resources should make the new site more flexible and powerful. It is also expected that data and service hosting will become more distributed in nature with UDOT, DNR and other state agencies expected to, or already pushing out their own data and services. AGRC will, of course, still provide hosting and provisioning services to those state and local agencies that are not positioned to become direct access points due to resource or other constraints. And, AGRC will also coordinate with those developing their own internal capability to ensure that these resources are cataloged with their own URLs in the SGID portion of the website.</p>
<p>The importance for the State of Utah is that geospatial resources including data, services, infrastructure, and expertise continue to expand into a more capable, more efficient enterprise-wide, highly connected network, better able to meet agency business needs and informing decision-makers.</p>
