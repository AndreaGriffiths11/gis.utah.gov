  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>AGRC has been working with county addressing authorities and GIS staff to develop a statewide address point dataset.  We are now using address points as the primary means of locating an address, with the location along a street segment as an alternate means.  Address points can provide a more accurate location than a geolocated point along a street segment.  This is particularly important for quickly dispatching public safety response to a home, business or other location.  </p>
<p>We have developed what we believe are best practices for address points: </p>
<p>- Each inhabited structure (residence or business) should have a point.<br />
- Each point should have a unique address, either from a unique house number or a unique unit number.  If a garage or out building is assigned a point, the address should be different from that of the primary structure. (Figure 1)<br />
- Points should be located at the structure. For multi-unit residences or multiple office suites, all the points for units accessed from each outside entrance should be located on or near each other. (Figures 2 &amp; 3)<br />
- A vacant parcel may have a point if it has a unique address.<br />
- The address for a point should be derived from the primary street name.  Additional points can also exist that are derived from alternate street names.</p>
<p>The full Address Point dataset schema and schema definitions are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTgknNbA0UNXnyMDR5q9gFAm0-XtNYQpLLYPSZtCLTU/edit#">here</a>. Address points are available for download <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/data/location/address-data/">here</a>.</p>
