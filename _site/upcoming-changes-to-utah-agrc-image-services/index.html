  <article class="post-content">
    <p>With the release of ArcGIS version 10.1 there are significant changes that will affect how AGRC image services are made available to end users.</p>
<p>ArcGIS 10.0 was the last supported release of the 'stand-alone' Image Server product, and, at 10.1 this product has been integrated into ArcGIS Server as the Image Extension.</p>
<p>When the AGRC moves to ArcGIS Server 10.1, we expect to run stand-alone Image Server 10.0 and the 10.1 ArcGIS Server Image Extension concurrently for several months.</p>
<p>At the end of this period, Image Server will be shut down and image services will only be available through the ArcGIS Server connection. It is important to note that links to any existing image service layer saved in a ArcMap document (mxd) will be broken and the map document may take an unusually long time to open. Therefore, it is important that users with mxd's accessing services in the stand-alone Image Server begin transitioning to the image services in ArcGIS Server as soon as the 10.1 server is available.</p>
<p>AT 10.0, users are able to connect to the AGRC Image Server via the Add Image Server Connection button <a href="/website/upcoming-changes-to-utah-agrc-image-services/isbutton/" rel="attachment wp-att-11544"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11544" title="Deadman walking: the old 10.0 Image Server button" src="/website/images/ISbutton.png" alt="" width="25" height="26" /></a> (at right) that they have added to their toolbar from ArcMap's Customize &gt;&gt; Commands &gt;&gt; Image Server menus.</p>
<p>Once AGRC has the 10.1 implementation available in a couple months, adding a 10.1 image service to ArcMap will start from the 'Add Data' button and then require navigating to a mapserv.utah.gov connection under the GIS Services folder. <a href="/website/upcoming-changes-to-utah-agrc-image-services/gisserverdialog-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-11560"><img class="alignright" style="padding-right: 15px;" title="Adding Data from mapserv.utah.gov" src="/website/images/GISServerDialog1.png" alt="" width="280" height="189" align="left" /></a> 10.1 image services will also be able to be previewed in ArcCatalog, and dragged and dropped into ArcMap as well.</p>
<p>During the forthcoming migration to ArcGIS Server 10.1 we hope to minimize any disruption. Connection properties to the new AGRC 10.1 Image Extension on mapserv.utah.gov will be posted here as soon as the 10.1 service is available. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact <a href="mailto:zbeck@utah.gov?subject=ImageServer migration questions">Zach Beck</a>.</p>
