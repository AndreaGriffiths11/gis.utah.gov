The install is complete and testing has proven repeatable results. This means it is time for everyone to begin converting over to the new system.</p>
<p>We would like to have everyone moved over to the new system by <strong>February 1, 2014</strong>, so please take some time get set up by following the 3 simple steps below. </p>
<p>*Note: If you do not have a current subscription please register and pay by going toturngps.utah.gov and click on the registration button. Fill in the requested information then pay with a credit card at the end.</p>
<p>Once you have a current paid account follow these 3 step to get connected to the new system:</p>
<p>Step 1<br />
In your internet browser type in the address bar 168.179.231.9 which brings up the Trimble Pivot web page. </p>
<p>Step 2<br />
Select Register (found on the left side) and fill in your Personal Data. Be sure to use a unique email for each account, and don't enter anything for GSM Phone Number for TNC.<br />
Select Next at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Step 3<br />
Fill in Login Data.<br />
For Organization it works best to keep it small or abbreviated.<br />
For Username use the one created when the account was purchased.<br />
For Password use anything you would like.</p>
<p>After these 3 steps are complete your account with Trimple Pivot is created, then within 24 hours you will receive an email confirming that your account has been approved followed by another email notifying you that your subscription has also been created. Once you receive these emails the account is active and you are ready to configure your data collector.</p>
<p>Set up your data collector exactly like the old VRS configuration, but change the IP Address to 168.179.231.9 and enter your new Username and Password.</p>
<p>If you have any problems or questions please feel free to contact one of us.</p>
