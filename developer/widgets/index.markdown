<h3>Save yourself some time and use our widgets!</h3>
<p><img src="http://gis.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/widget.png" class="alignleft" /></p>
<p>AGRC is actively developing and maintaining a core set of geospatial javascript widgets and ArcMap Addons.  These widgets allow for developers and non-developers to incorporate geospatial functionality into their website, blog, or GIS environment.  All of our widgets and addons are powered by our <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/developer/web-services">geospatial web APIs</a> that you can also use to create your own addons and wigdets.</p>
<h4>Javascript Widgets</h4>
<p>A great place to get started with our javascript widgets is the <a href="http://mapserv.utah.gov/docs/dojo">documentation</a> website.  While on those pages, navigate to the test pages to see the widgets in action.  Also, all of our public websites are using the widget library so you may already be familiar with them!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, our widget library allows you to have a user locate things by<br />
[list style="list4"]
<ul>
<li>Geocode their address with the FindAddress Widget - Type in an address and get a UTM or latitude longitude coordinate, optionally zooming a map to the location.</li>
<li>Find anything based on an attribute with the FindGeneric widget - Zoom a map to any layer in our SGID. eg: Zoom to county or municipality.</li>
<li>Find valid township, range, and sections with the TRSsearch widget - Zoom a map or get the formatted TRS value from this widget.</li>
</ul>
<p>[/list] </p>
<p>You can also quickly add common mapping elements: map, base map selector, layer list, etc to your website or blog.</p>
<p>There are plans to open source our widget library and take on contributions. This will easily allow for other developers to make changes our code. Check our <a href="http://github.com/agrc">github repository</a> and fork the code!</p>
<h4>ArcMap Addons</h4>
<p>We are not currently publicly distributing ArcMap addons but we have plans to do so.  Our first addon will allow users to batch geocode against our <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/developer/web-services/">geospatial web APIs</a> to get the best matches possible.</p>
