<h4><strong>Land Ownership</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Data Type:</strong> GIS Data Layer<br />
<strong>Steward(s):</strong> SITLA, BLM, &amp; Partners</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Cadastre.LandOwnership feature class depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for the State of Utah surface lands at a scale of 1:24,000.  Maintenance of this data layer is performed by a cooperative federal and state effort between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA).  Cadastre.LandOwnership is a statewide dataset of land ownership status, and therefore is a compilation of all surface land ownership administration, and designation categories, which are listed below.  Both the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) update this dataset regularly.  Revisions of the dataset are made available weekly through the AGRC SGID Database Server.  Standard colors are recommended when displaying this feature class. A layer file containing the standard color scheme is available by contacting SITLA GIS staff directly by calling 801-538-5100, emailing <a href="mailto: TLA-GIS@utah.gov">TLA-GIS@utah.gov</a>, or visiting <a href="http://trustlands.utah.gov">http://trustlands.utah.gov</a>.</p>

<dt>DESIG (the "type" of land use or designation â€“ general land management designations)</dt>
<p>Describes the "Type" of Land Use or Designation. This field characterizes general land management designations for parcels of land. This field describes how or for what use the land is to be managed. (ex: Designated as Wilderness, National Park, State Park)This field can accommodate, if necessary, further withdrawals, leases, or permits designated by the ADMIN. E.g. If the USFS places a withdrawal on a parcel, i.e. for wilderness designation, the DESIG field can be used to account for this case. However, only a single designation can be addressed in the DESIG field; we cannot account for multiple withdrawals, leases, or permits on a parcel in this data standard. The data steward or editor must decide the most pertinent information to describe in the DESIG field.</p>
