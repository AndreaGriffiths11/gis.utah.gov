<p>SGID93.Transportation.Roads is the recommended starting point for almost anything related to Utah street centerlines. This includes cartography, address location, and, now,&nbsp;network analysis. (It also worth mentioning that the UDOT linear referencing system is derived from attributes in this dataset)<br><br>While data used to support network analysis has many potential parameters, at a basic level, two components are especially important: 1) connectivity and 2) impedance (i.e. travel speed/costs).</p>
<p>Connectivity of centerline features in SGID93.Transportation.Roads is actively maintained but an impedance measure, while planned for later this year, has not bee actively enforced to date. However, it is possible to use a combination of cartographic feature codes (CFCC field), spatial queries, and the existing values in the SPD_LMT field&nbsp;to create a relatively crude but effective representation of speed limits&nbsp;that, then, can be used&nbsp;as an input to an&nbsp;impedance measure.</p>
<p>Using the steps decribed in the Process Notes below, SGID93.Transportation.Roads, was used to create a simple network solution (aka "routable") GIS dataset that can be used for routing, service area, and allocation problems.</p>
<p>The finished draft product is available for download in a v10 file geodatabase. </p>

</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that this is a first draft at a simple network dataset created to guide future AGRC efforts to improve and maintain routing capability in conjunction with SGID93.Transportation.Roads. There are a lot of different approaches and choices of what built-in functionality to employ. Expect that this approach will change as we learn more about the ArcGIS 10 Network Analysis capabilities and continue to hone our data for routing. </p>
<p>Any and all feedback (email <a href="mailto:%20bgranberg@utah.gov" target="_blank">bgranberg@utah.gov</a> ) is encouraged and will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Process Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
   <li>1) Create a new file geodatabase and within it, a feature dataset whose spatial reference is defined by importing the spatial reference from SGID93.Transportation.Roads. Copy SGID93.Transportation.Roads into thew new feature dataset</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
   <li>2) To SGID93.Transportation.Roads Add:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>a text field USEEXIST (length 1)</li>
      <li>a text field URBTRAFFIC (length 1)</li>
      <li>a double field IMPED_MIN</li>
      <li>a double field F_T_IMP_MIN</li>
      <li>a double field T_F_IMP_MIN</li>
      <li>a short integer field SUB_TYPE<br></li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>3) Make new a polygon feature class of areas where surface streets are likely to encounter traffic controls at intersections (merge incorporated cities with major unincorporated areas). Store this in the new filegeodatabase as a standalone feature class (not in feature dataset).<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
   <li>4) Use the query below to calculate to a value of "1", all roads for which you want to preserve potentially valid speed limit data already in SGID93.Transportation.Roads</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>not (SPD_LMT is null) and ( SPD_LMT &gt;= 10 and SPD_LMT &lt;= 80)</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>5) For all other features (query below), calculate the speed limit field to 25</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1'</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>6) Use a query to isolate UDOT freeways and set the speed to 75</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>"CFCC" = 'A15' and (USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1')</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>7) Use a query to set speeds on&nbsp; all major state and US highways to 65*</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
   <li>
      <blockquote>
         <ul>
            <li>((CFCC = 'A31' or CFCC = 'A35') and ALT_NAME like 'SR%') and (USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1')</li>
         </ul>
      </blockquote>
   </li>
   <li>8) Use a query to isolate UDOT freeway collectors/feeders and set the speed to 55</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>"DOT_RTNAME" like '%C%' and (USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1')</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>9) Use a query to isolate UDOT ramps and set the speed limit to 40</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>"DOT_RTNAME" like '%R%' and (USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1')</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>10) Use a query to set the speeds on major local roads to 55</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;((CFCC = 'A31' or CFCC = 'A35') and (ALT_NAME is null or ALT_NAME = '') and( not (DOT_RTNAME like '0%') or DOT_RTNAME is null)) and (USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1')</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>11) Use a query to set the speeds on unpaved major roads to 45</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>CFCC = 'A40' and (USEEXIST is null or "USEEXIST" &lt;&gt; '1')</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>12) Use Select By Location to select all roads that intersect the polygon feature class of urban areas and rural cities created in Step 3. For these selected roads, calculate URBTRAFFIC to a value of '1'.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
   <li>13) Down grade the speeds on all non-divided major local and major highways in settled areas to 40 using the query below. Also exclude Bangerter Highway and US 89 in Davis County. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>(CFCC = 'A31' or CFCC = 'A21' ) and URBTRAFFIC = '1'&nbsp; and ( ALT_NAME is null or (ALT_NAME &lt;&gt; 'SR 154'&nbsp; and not (ALT_NAME = 'US 89' and DOT_RTPART = '10')))</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>14) Down grade the speeds on all freeways in settled areas to 65 using the query below</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>CFCC = 'A15' and URBTRAFFIC = '1' </li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>15) Calculate impedence (in minutes) for all ramp-accessed roads (freeways) using query and calculation below:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>Query: CFCC = 'A15' or CFCC = 'A25' or CFCC = 'A35'&nbsp; or "DOT_RTNAME" like '%R%' or "DOT_RTNAME" like '%C%' or URBTRAFFIC&nbsp; is null</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>Calculation: ( [SHAPE_Length]/1609 * 60) / [SPD_LMT]</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>16) Switch the selection and calculate the impedance (in minutes) for all traffic controlled roads by increasing the travel time by a factor of 1.3 (<strong>CHANGE TO 1.5 in future network builds to make for more realistic travel times!</strong>) to account for stop signs, signals, and turns</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
   <ul>
      <li>Query: CFCC = 'A15' or CFCC = 'A25' or CFCC = 'A35'&nbsp; or "DOT_RTNAME" like '%R%' or "DOT_RTNAME" like '%C%' or URBTRAFFIC = '1'<br><br></li>
      <li>Calculation: ( [SHAPE_Length]/1609 * 60) / [SPD_LMT] *1.3 <strong>(CHANGE TO 1.5 in future builds) </strong></li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
   <li>17) Impedance needed to be be set differently for each direction on oneway streets and routes. Currently many of the ONE_WAY attributes for limited access freeways/highways needed to be fixed (this should be done in the next update of SGID93.Transportation.Roads in early April. Here's how this was done:</li>
